# FDF
This project is about creating a simplified graphic “wireframe” (“fils de fer” in french,
hence the name of the project) representation of a relief landscape linking various points
(x, y, z) via segments. The coordinates of this landscape are stored in a file passed as
a parameter to the program. You can check out any maps that in the map folder.
## What my FDF can do:
- you can rotate the image with your mouse
- rotate the image on X, Y, or Z axis
- move the image up and down, right and left
- scrool in and out, changing it's scale
- change colors
- it has 4 projection types
- you can change altitude parameter of all pixels
- you can draw a line with two right clicks
## Usage:
Just run make, and then ./fdf map_name
